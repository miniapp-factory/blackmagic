#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a lightbulb icon with a gradient of blue and green colors, surrounded by subtle sparkles to represent creativity and inspiration. The background is a soft pastel gradient from light blue at the top to light green at the bottom, giving a fresh and energetic feel. The lightbulb is centered and slightly tilted, with a filament that glows softly, symbolizing ideas. The overall design is clean, modern, and suitable for a mobile and web app icon.
